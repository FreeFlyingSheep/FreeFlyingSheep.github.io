Hello and welcome to my new blog!

## About This Blog

This blog is built using [Hugo Toha](https://github.com/hugo-toha/toha).

This blog supports multiple languages, but the content may not always be perfectly synchronized.
Since I might use a different tone or wording in different versions, translations won't always be exact, as you can see in this introduction.
For now, I'll primarily focus on a single language to keep things consistent.

A quick note: English is my second language, so I use AI tools to help polish my writing.
If you ever spot any mistakes or have suggestions, feel free to let me know—I'm always looking to improve!

## What Happened to My Old Blog?

If you've been following my previous blog, you might have noticed that it's no longer available—don't worry!
It has been archived [here](https://github.com/FreeFlyingSheep/blog-old), and I plan to migrate some of the old posts here over time.

## What to Expect?

Going forward, I'll be sharing posts on technology, software development, and open-source projects.
Stay tuned for more updates, and feel free to reach out with any thoughts or feedback!
