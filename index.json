[{"categories":[],"contents":"Hello and welcome to my new blog!\nAbout This Blog This blog is built using Hugo Toha.\nThis blog supports multiple languages, but the content may not always be perfectly synchronized. Since I might use a different tone or wording in different versions, translations won\u0026rsquo;t always be exact, as you can see in this introduction. For now, I\u0026rsquo;ll primarily focus on a single language to keep things consistent.\nA quick note: English is my second language, so I use AI tools to help polish my writing. If you ever spot any mistakes or have suggestions, feel free to let me know—I\u0026rsquo;m always looking to improve!\nWhat Happened to My Old Blog? If you\u0026rsquo;ve been following my previous blog, you might have noticed that it\u0026rsquo;s no longer available—don\u0026rsquo;t worry! It has been archived here, and I plan to migrate some of the old posts here over time.\nWhat to Expect? Going forward, I\u0026rsquo;ll be sharing posts on technology, software development, and open-source projects. Stay tuned for more updates, and feel free to reach out with any thoughts or feedback!\n","date":"March 8, 2025","hero":"/images/default-hero.jpg","permalink":"https://FreeFlyingSheep.github.io/posts/introduction/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHello and welcome to my new blog!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"about-this-blog\"\u003eAbout This Blog\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis blog is built using \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/hugo-toha/toha\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eHugo Toha\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis blog supports multiple languages, but the content may not always be perfectly synchronized.\nSince I might use a different tone or wording in different versions, translations won\u0026rsquo;t always be exact, as you can see in this introduction.\nFor now, I\u0026rsquo;ll primarily focus on a single language to keep things consistent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA quick note: English is my second language, so I use AI tools to help polish my writing.\nIf you ever spot any mistakes or have suggestions, feel free to let me know—I\u0026rsquo;m always looking to improve!\u003c/p\u003e","tags":["Multilingual"],"title":"Introduction"}]
